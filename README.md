# Feelify.AI

**Feelify.AI** is an AI-powered emotional assistant chatbot designed to provide mental health and emotional support to students. Built using Flask, Google Generative AI (Gemini API), and OpenCV, this application leverages natural language understanding to offer a safe, empathetic, and supportive space for users to share their feelings and receive personalized self-care suggestions.

## Features
- **Emotional Support Chatbot**: The chatbot interacts with students by responding empathetically to their messages. It helps students manage stress, track emotions, and offers motivational advice and self-care tips.
- **Emotion Detection via Webcam**: A video stream is used to analyze facial expressions, detecting emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral. The background color changes dynamically based on the detected emotions.
- **Generative AI**: Utilizes the Google Gemini API to generate thoughtful, empathetic responses tailored to the user's emotional state.
- **Simple, Friendly UI**: A user-friendly interface where users can chat with the bot and see real-time emotion detection.
